# 🏳️ 2025 Training Bootcamp [PAUSED]

> **📢 Status Update:** *We are pivoting!* 🔄

This repository was established to document our deep dive into game engine fundamentals. However, at **Lumoria Studios**, we believe in **"Team First, Tools Second."**

We have decided to put this specific roadmap on a **strategic pause**.
Why? Because we found a faster lane to learn shipping, collaboration, and game loops. We are shifting our focus to a new, more rapid environment to build our synergy before returning to deep-dive mechanics.

### 🔮 What's Next?
We aren't stopping. We are just shifting gears to a slightly "blockier" playground to ship our first title faster. 🧱

👉 *Keep an eye on the [Lumoria Studios Profile](https://github.com/Lumoria-Studios) to see our new active project surfacing soon!*
