## We are going to Start from Scratch and Aim to Create our "**Dream Game**"!

We’ll follow the roadmap we created as a team, using AI-assisted guidance to optimize our learning journey. Each member will develop small projects along the way to reinforce the topics we study!

# That's All So far 👋

We'll update this README.md later on! See you later!! ^^
